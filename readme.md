Over the past few years, in my experience of volunteering for program committees
of various NOG programs. I observed that we heavily rely on emails and spreadsheets
for our program progress tracking. The need for a proper management system was evidant.

I shared the idea of building such a platform with my friends at [INNOG](https://innog.net), and feedback was 100% positive.
I will try to reach out to other NOGs in the region to discuss the idea, as & when time permits.


_The ultimate goal is to make the project usable for as many NOGs as possible._


Checkout project wiki for [planned features](https://github.com/rahulmkhj/nogms/wiki/Planned-Features-List) and 
[Screenshots](https://github.com/rahulmkhj/nogms/wiki/Screenshots) see how the UI looks like.

I also maintain a [supporters page](https://github.com/rahulmkhj/nogms/wiki/Supporters) to credit 
those who have contributed to the project.
